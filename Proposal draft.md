## Introduction

In today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, organizations rely on an average of 130+ Software as a Service (SaaS) applications to power their operations. However, managing user access across these diverse platforms presents significant operational challenges, particularly when many SaaS applications lack comprehensive APIs for automated user management. Manual user provisioning and deprovisioning processes are not only time-intensive but also prone to human error, security vulnerabilities, and compliance risks.

The traditional approach to SaaS user management involves IT administrators manually creating accounts, assigning permissions, and removing access when employees change roles or leave the organization. This process can consume 40+ hours per quarter for access reviews alone, while also creating security gaps through orphaned accounts and delayed deprovisioning. Furthermore, 40% of SaaS applications currently lack the robust APIs necessary for programmatic user management, forcing organizations to rely on manual, web-based interactions.

CloudEagle AutoPilot addresses these critical pain points by introducing an innovative AI-driven solution that automates user management tasks across SaaS applications without requiring traditional API access. By leveraging advanced computer vision, natural language processing, and intelligent UI automation technologies, CloudEagle AutoPilot transforms how organizations manage their SaaS user lifecycles, delivering unprecedented efficiency, security, and scalability.
